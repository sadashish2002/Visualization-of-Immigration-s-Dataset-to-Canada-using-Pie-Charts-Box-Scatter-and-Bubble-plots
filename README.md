# Exploring Datasets with pandas and Matplotlib

Toolkits: The course heavily relies on pandas and Numpy for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. The primary plotting library we will explore in the course is Matplotlib.

Dataset: Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 - International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision from United Nation's website.

The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals. In this lab, we will focus on the Canadian Immigration data.
